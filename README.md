Pastesites are websites that allows users to share plain text through public posts called “pastes.” 

Once attackers compromise the external perimeter and gain access to the internal resources they release the part of data on the "paste" sites like pastebin or hastebin. As these hackers or malicious groups publish dumps on such sites others users can see sensitive information through such sites.
